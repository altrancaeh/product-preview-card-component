## My process

Started with analyzing how many layers I'd need in order to properly fit the content, images and texts. Then i proceeded to creating the sections, divs and providing all with ids in order to facilitate styling in CSS. The main issue that i had to deal (learn) was all about Media Queries and Divs positioning. I still think i need A LOT of improvement regarding mobile-first layouts and CSS code disposition, but i'll get there eventually.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Little more about media queries
Divs positioning

### Continued development

I need to continue focus on learning CSS regarding positions, mobile-first coding and best practices of clean code. In HTML, my main focus is going to be how to create the best semantic and just the right amount of sections and divs.

### Useful resources

- [Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) - Knowledgebase.
